# Interactive Coding Quiz

## Description

This is an interactive coding quiz that asks you a series of questions and saves your scores. You have 60 seconds to complete this quiz. When you answer a question incorrectly times is deducted. When the quiz is over you can save your score. I challenged myself to learn and practice using web API's to build this web application. This also helps people learning to code by asking them basic coding questions.

## Installation

Deploy the URL to access the coding quiz. You can also follow the link to the GitHub repository to view the code!

## Usage

Once the URL is deployed you will see a "Start Quiz" button. Click the button to begin the quiz. Answer the questions as quickly as you can to avoid running out of time. For ever incorrect answer time will be deducted and your score will be saved locally at the end of the quiz using your initials.

## Credits

University of Utah Coding Bootcamp Instructors and Teaching Assistants are credited with providing the learning material I used to build this application. I also used the help of AI to help generate some basic outlines for this webpage. W3 schools provided documentation for the Web API's used to build this.
